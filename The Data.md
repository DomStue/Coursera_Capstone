The data comprises of 194673 total entries and the number of categories or parameters is 37. The severity of the car accidents is measured as a categorical number, which means a supervised classification model is used for this dataset. Although the scale goes from 0 to 3, only entries with 1(prop damage) and 2 (injury) are included. The categories include several information about the accident, like the location, persons and cars involved, injuries of persons, the type of collisions, the road, wheather or light conditions and time and dates.

Data will be explored for missing entries and if they include valuable, causal information which may effect the severity of the car accidents. Afterwards, a classification model such as KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression or Decision will be apllied.
